A lot of times, students only see statistics as useful because they want to get a good grade in it, or because they need to know it for a test. But the content you learn in statistics also can relate to your life in different ways.&nbsp;</p>


<p>We asked students who took this course in the Winter and Spring 2022 term to think about how statistics was related to their lives. We want to know what you think about their responses. Your feedback will help us better understand students’ attitudes about statistics and help students who take this class in the future. Please rate the following quotations according to how interesting, relatable, and convincing you find them to be.</p>

A lot of times, students only see statistics as useful because they want to get a good grade in it, or because they need to know it for a test. But the content you learn in statistics also can relate to your life in different ways.
We asked students who took this course in the Winter and Spring 2022 term to think about how statistics was related to their lives. We want to know what you think about their responses. Your feedback will help us better understand students’ attitudes about statistics and help students who take this class in the future. Please rate the following quotations according to how interesting, relatable, and convincing you find them to be.

""Initially I did not understand how I could use statistics outside of this course. But when I started working in a non-profit organization I was able to use what I am learning here to visualize how funding was disbursed to the surrounding communities. My stats knowledge allowed us to identify which communities needed the most support.""

<p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><strong>“I never realized how relevant and applicable statistics was to my everyday life until I learned about modeling. For example, I have been trying to improve my mood and productivity since starting college by making sort of a mental model. I noticed that if I get enough sleep, get fresh air everyday, get some exercise in (even if it’s just a walk), and connect with my friends and family, my mood increases and I feel more productive. In this case, my mood/productivity is the outcome variable and sleep, fresh air, exercise, and social connections are possible explanatory variables.”</strong></p>

For example for the first year of the pandemic I consistently thought I was getting Covid because I woke up with a scratchy throat. So I saw it as scratchy throat = Covid-19 infection + other stuff. I routinely got tested, and it came back negative every single time, so I defaulted back to scratchy throat = other stuff. Then I went to the doctor for a routine check-up and found out I was allergic to cats (at the time I lived with two). As it turns out, my model should be scratchy throat = cat allergy + other stuff!""

A lot of times, students only see statistics as useful because they want to get a good grade in it, or because they need to know it for a test. But the content you learn in statistics also can relate to your life in different ways.
We asked students who took this course in the Winter and Spring 2022 term to think about how statistics was related to their lives. We want to know what you think about their responses. Your feedback will help us better understand students’ attitudes about statistics and help students who take this class in the future. Please rate the following quotations according to how interesting, relatable, and convincing you find them to be.
