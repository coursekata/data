# Data from 2023 College Courses

Publicly available CourseKata data from college courses that used a CourseKata textbook (ABC or ABCD) in 2023.

- 1625 unique students from 48 classes in 11 institutions of higher education (28 of those unique students are in more than one class)
- Took a college course in 2023 that used one of the CourseKata statistics and data science textbooks

These data have been anonymized, even more so than data that is available to Coursekata researchers in that we have:

- removed open responses or short text (replaced with NA)
- removed coding responses (replaced with NA)
